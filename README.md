## Project Summary:

go-cmc calls CoinMarketcap API endpoints and updates the database with up to date data for each identified coin/token. Package to be used by external app to keep DB up to date. 

- Built in go 1.23.5
- Uses John Barton's [dotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)

### Services:

The app relies on 2 main packages/services: 
1. Mapper: Generates a Coinmarketcap ID map used by the Ticker service to fetch data for each coin/token. Uses DB, API call and fallback map for failsafe implementation.
2. Ticker: Fetch up to date data for every coin/token in ID map generated by mapper. Makes API call at set interval and stores data in DB. 

### Setup/Run:

- Clone the repository
- Get an API key from [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
- Rename .env.example to .env
- Add your API Key to .env CMC_API_KEY=
- In .env, set the time interval for the API call based on how many credits you want to spend. Default set to 120 seconds for ticker.
- Run in command prompt: 
    ```shell
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
